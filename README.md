# SI618 Final Project

Airline Industry EDA: 2017 vs. 2021. This repository examines airline stock prices and flight delays in 2017 (pre-COVID-19) and 2021 (recovery phase). Single-year data may not fully represent the pandemic's impact.

To start, clone the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/theuerc/airlines_2017_2021
```

Then navigate to the `src` folder in the cloned repository and run the following commands:

```
pipenv install
pipenv shell
jupyter notebook
```

This will install all of the dependencies required for the analysis. The jupyter notebook with the analysis and code is `src/notebooks/01_clt_rm_full_project.ipynb`. There is also a `Final Report.pdf` file in the base directory that writes up our findings, and a rendered html file of the jupyter notebook called `01_clt_rm_full_project.html`.

This project was co-author by Coulton Theuer and Rohit Maramraju.
